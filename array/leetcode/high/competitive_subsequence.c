    1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence
    Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the
    most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.

    An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing
    some (possibly zero) elements from the array.

    We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence
    b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ,
    subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For
    example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first
    position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [3,5,2,6], k = 2
    Output: [2,6]
    Explanation: Among the set of every possible subsequence:
    {[3,5], [3,2], [3,6], [5,2], [5,6], [2,6]}, [2,6] is the most competitive.
    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,4,3,3,5,4,9,6], k = 4
    Output: [2,3,3,4]

    Overview: Solution :

    The problem is to build the most competitive subsequence of
    size k for a given array nums.

    A subsequence is different from a subarray. Unlike subarray,
    which contains only contiguous array elements, in subsequence of
    an array, we can skip any number of elements given
    that the ordering of elements is maintained.

    For array = [2,3,5,6,7,8],[5,6,7] is subarray as well as
    subsequence. Whereas, [5,6,8] is a subsequence but not a subarray.

    For the given array, we have to generate all its subsequences with
    size k and then find the one which satisfies the criteria of being
    most competitive. Now, what are the criteria for being the most
    competitive subsequence?

    The most competitive subsequence is the one in which the value of
    the element at every position/index is smallest among values of
    all the subsequences at that position. Let's understand with an example.

    Let nums = [2, 3, 4] and k = 2.

    We could generate three subsequences of size 3 from the given
    nums array, seq1:[2, 3], seq2:[2, 4], seq3:[3, 4].

    -> Let's compare all the subsequences at index 000. seq1 and seq2 has
    element 2 at 0th position. Whereas, seq3 has an element 3 which
    is greater than 2. Considering index 0, seq1 and seq2 can be the
    most competitive sequence as the value at 0th index is smallest
    among other subsequences.

    Now, let's compare the remaining subsequences at index 111. seq1 has
    value 333 at 1st index which is smaller than value 4 at 1st index in seq2.

    This gives us subsequence seq1:[2, 3] as the most competitive sequence among all.

    Based on these insights, let's implement the solution.

    Apprpch: Using Double-Ended Queue :

    We have to choose elements for our subsequence such that every element is the
    smallest possible value for that array position.

    The naive solution would be to generate all the possible subsequences of an array
    and compare the element at every position to find the most competitive subsequence.
    This approach is too exhaustive. What could be a better way to implement the solution?

    Instead of building all the subsequences and then finding the one matching the criteria,
    we could scan the array and build the required subsequence. We would choose the elements
    for every position/index for the resultant subsequence that would be the most
    competitive element for that position.

    For 1st1^{st}1st position in the resultant subsequence, we would try to choose the
    smallest possible value in the array, the next smaller element for the 2nd
    position, and so on. In other words, we could say that we would try to build the
    subsequence in Increasing Order. Any element that does not follow the order would be
    ignored or dropped. Let's understand all possible cases with an example.

    Example, if nums = [3, 2, 5, 4] and k = 3.
    We have to build the most competitive subsequence of size 333. Let's scan the
    array from left to right and build the result.

    index = 0 , element = 3.
    We start by choosing element 333 for the 1st1^{st}1st position in result,
    result = [3, _ , _ ].

    index = 1 , element = 2.
    We find that the next element is 222, which is smaller than last chosen element 333,
    hence we can drop or remove 333 and replace it by 222 at 1st1^{st}1st position
    in result, result = [2, _ , _ ].

    index = 2 , element = 5.
    Now, the current element 555 is greater than than last chosen element 222 in result,
    thus we could choose 555 for 2nd2^{nd}2nd position in result, result = [2, 5, _ ].

    index = 3 , element = 4.
    Again, the current element 444 is smaller than the last chosen element 555, but this
    time we cannot replace 555 with 444. Because we have to build a result of size 333
    and this is the last element we have. If we remove 555 at 2nd2^{nd}2nd position in
    result and replace it with 444, we won't be able to find another element for 3rd
    position. Hence, we must keep 555 at the 2nd2^{nd}2nd position and add 444 at the
    3rd position in the result. result = [2, 5, 4].

    With the above example, we can state that to build the most competitive subsequence,

    We must try to choose the smallest possible element for every position.
    We have to choose at least kkk elements.

    Let's understand how we can implement the intuition in detail.
    Algorithm :

    To implement the solution discussed above, we need 2 things,

    First, we need a data structure that could hold the chosen elements for the resultant
    subsequence. We should be able to add or remove any number of elements from the
    end of the subsequence, as well as read elements at the beginning of the
    subsequence. The data structure that comes in our mind is Double-Ended Queue.

    Second, we need a way to know the number of elements we could drop from the array
    nums to build the resultant subsequence.

    For example, if nums = [3, 4, 1] and k = 3, we know that we cannot drop any element
    from the array, and the result would be [3, 4, 1]. Hence, there are 000 elements that can be dropped.

    If nums = [3, 4, 1, 5] and k = 3, we know that we can drop 111 element from the array
    as we need only 333 elements in the resultant subsequence.

    Let additionalCount\text{additionalCount}additionalCount be the number of elements that we
    can drop from the array nums to build the result. Initially, additionalCount
    would be initialized to ( length of nums array - k )

    Steps:
    Build a double-ended queue, named queue that holds the chosen subsequence at
    any given point.

    Iterate over array nums, choose the most competitive elements and add it
    to the queue.

    Compare the last element of the queue (last chosen element for the resultant
    subsequence) with the current element.

    Until the last element of the queue is greater than the current element and
    additionalCount is greater than 000, we know that we can remove the last chosen element
    from the queue and replace it with the current element which is smaller and hence a
    better candidate. Every time an element is removed from queue, decrement the
    additionalCount by 111.

    Otherwise, simply add the current element at the end of the queue.
    In the end, we have the most suitable candidates in the queue. Get the
    first kkk elements from the queue and build the resultant array.
    The following figure illustrates the idea for nums = [3, 6, 4, 2, 1] and k = 3.
