/*
  673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
  Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.
  Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.
  Example 1:
  Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
  Example 2:
  Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
  Output: 5
  Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1,
  and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
  Constraints:
  1 <= nums.length <= 2000
  -106 <= nums[i] <= 106

    Approach 1: Dynamic Programming
    Intuition and Algorithm :
    Suppose for sequences ending at nums[i], we knew the length length[i] of the
    longest sequence, and the number count[i] of such sequences with that length.

    For every i < j with A[i] < A[j], we might append A[j] to a longest subsequence
    ending at A[i]. It means that we have demonstrated count[i] subsequences of length length[i] + 1.

    Now, if those sequences are longer than length[j], then we know we have count[i]
    sequences of this length. If these sequences are equal in length to length[j],
    then we know that there are now count[i] additional sequences to be counted of
    that length (ie. count[j] += count[i]).
