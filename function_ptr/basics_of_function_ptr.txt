Q: What does

typedef int (*funcptr)();

mean?

A: It defines a typedef, funcptr, for a pointer to a function (taking unspecified arguments)
returning an int. It can be used to declare one or more pointers to functions:

	funcptr pf1, pf2;

which is equivalent to the more verbose, and perhaps harder to understand

	int (*pf1)(), (*pf2)();
