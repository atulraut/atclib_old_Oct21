Sliding Window Technique :
This technique shows how a nested for loop in some problems can
be converted to a single for loop to reduce the time complexity.

Sliding Window Technique is a method for finding subarrays in an
array that satisfy given conditions. We do this via maintaining a
subset of items as our window, and resize and move that window
within the larger list until we find a solution. Sliding Window
Technique is a subset of Dynamic Programming
