/*
  Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as
  few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped,
  bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, etc).

/*
  SOLUTION
  Mask all odd bits with 10101010 in binary (which is 0xAA), then shift them
  left to put them in the even bits. Then, perform a similar operation for
  even bits. This takes a total 5 instructions.

  Using 0x55 : As mask clears bits in position 1/3/5/ etc.
  Using 0xaa : As mask clears bits in position 0/2/4/6 etc.
