/*
 Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
  is to   flip the bits of its binary representation.
  Note:
    The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
    You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1: Input: 5 Output: 2
  Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
  its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2: Input: 1 Output: 0
  Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its
  complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
