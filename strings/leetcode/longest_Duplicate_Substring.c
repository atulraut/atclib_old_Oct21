/***
 * Longest Duplicate Substring
 * Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous)
 * substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)
 * Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.
 * (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "banana"
 * Output: "ana"
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "abcd"
 * Output: ""
 * Note:
 *     2 <= S.length <= 10^5
 *     S consists of lowercase English letters.

/***
    LeetCode : Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring
    without repeating characters.

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

    Example 2:
    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

    Example 3:
    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

    Example 4:
    Input: s = ""
    Output: 0

    Constraints:
    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
