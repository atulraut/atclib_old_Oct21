/***
    Hard: Given two strings s and t, return the number of
    distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

    A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the
    original string by deleting some (can be none) of the
    characters without disturbing the remaining characters'
    relative positions. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence
    of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

    It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

    Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
    rabbbit
    rabbbit
    rabbbit

    Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
    babgbag
    babgbag
    babgbag
    babgbag
    babgbag

    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
    s and t consist of English letters.
