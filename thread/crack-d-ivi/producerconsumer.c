/*
 *  Solution to Producer Consumer Problem Using Pthreads, a mutex and condition variables
 *  From Tanenbaum, Modern Operating Systems, 3rd Ed. In this version the buffer is a single number.
 *  The producer is putting numbers into the shared buffer (in this case sequentially)
 *  And the consumer is taking them out. If the buffer contains zero, that indicates that the buffer is empty.
 *  Any other value is valid.
 *
 *  You use the SIGNAL operation to add or return
 *  resources to the shared pool.
 *  And you use the WAIT operation to allocate a resource
 *  for your exclusive use.
 *  The Producer consumes spaces & Produces Characters
 *  The Consumer consumes characters & produces spaces.
 *  Check thread_2.png
 *
 *  To Compile =-->    g++ producerconsumerpthread.c  -o main.out -pthread -std=c++11
